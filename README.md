# Stock Prediction using RNN and LSTM
This project aims to predict stock prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) models.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
## Usage
1. Clone the repository ---> git clone https://github.com/ajaykumar1609/stock-prediction.git
2. Install the required packages
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook ---> jupyter notebook stock_prediction.ipynb
## Files

- `stock_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the RNN and LSTM models
- `data/`: Folder containing the stock data used for training and evaluation
- `data`: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/nifty50-stock-market-data
